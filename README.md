# LMSLocalLibrary

LMSLocalLibrary is a library management system for (fictional) The Local Library. 
It is a web application developed using Spring Boot.

LMSLocalLibrary is used by library staff and library users. It accesses a database with 
information about users, books and checkouts.

The registration and login features are identical for staff and users. The staff has admin 
role added separately (not through this application).

Library staff are able to:
- run specialized searches (e.g. search if a title has been checked out or is available, search 
what a specific user has checked out currently etc.)
- add new books to the library collection
- edit user account information
- edit book information

Library users are able to:
- edit their account information
- run basic searches (e.g. search books by title, author or category)
- view their current checkouts
- return books
- renew books
